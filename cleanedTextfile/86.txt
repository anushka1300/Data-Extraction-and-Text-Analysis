Will Machine Replace The Human Future Work Blackcoffer Insights Anything rise smarter human intelligence Artificial Intelligence brain computer interfaces neuroscience based human intelligence enhancement wins hands contest world Nothing league Eliezer Yudkowsky Researcher There denying robots automation increasingly daily lives Just grocery store highway This makes replace human intelligence What make relevant tomorrow Let find answers questions Let understand Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence basically machines displaying intelligence This machine playing chess robot answering questions Facebook Artificial Intelligence broken types There AIs designed specific tasks detecting specific type cancer However AIs multiple tasks driving There types AIs Among top important fields Machine Learning Neural Network Computer Vision Natural Language Processing NLP Machine Learning idea machines prove similar human learns skill Machine Learning optimization existing

Artificial Neural Networks medical fields diagnose cancers lung cancer prostate cancer Computer Vision idea computers visions This things human beings potentially human beings depending programming camera Computer Vision autonomous vehicles navigation Natural Language Processing idea computers listen Siri Siri listen demands process means answer based researched Now Let talk issue AIs automation jobs replacing humans This means job loss concentration wealth selected people This destabilization society social unrest addition social unrest improves This means smarter faster cheaper implement repetitive things humans preparing fast food It predicted improve 50 100 years super intelligent This means smarter intelligent human earth According experts Elon Musk human civilization potentially start humans burn crops sorts tragedies reserved human functions At point theory stop thought obstacles prevent goal This means unplug machine effect replace human intelligence But 10 30 years The field Artificial Intelligence sophisticated human tasks humans Currently smart empathetic humans strategically solve complex problems solutions expensive tests standards implement It takes improve Boston Dynamics world top robotics company robot 2009 needed assistance walk Fast forward 2019 robot walk jump objects backflips addition timing takes price technological solution drop point affordable desktop computer costs 1000 1999 significantly powerful laptop price curve But 10 30 years Will make human intelligence obsolete Maybe As proven earlier faster cheaper As companies technology automate jobs save money increase productivity importantly stay competitive As demonstrated repetition machine learning The difference learn faster progresses due amount data today It learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks important skills However repetitive routine tasks understand emotional intelligence ethics creativity This distinct IBM IBM IBM Watson program create
