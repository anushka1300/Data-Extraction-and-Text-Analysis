memory This capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past The hippocampus located brain temporal lobe responsible type memory Consciousness plays important memory distinctions One distinction implicit explicit characteristics explicit memory consciously implicit memory includes events conscious Furthermore empirical findings suggest declarative memory consciousness meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness Working memory operates maintains consciously perceived information temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks The testing information lacking essential aspects including spatial resolution temporal resolution scope Examples methods fMRI implanted electrodes fMRI temporal resolution problems localizability difficulties implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons restricted scope Hence huge numbers speculations testable fundamental level difficult test Mental illness Consciousness influence objects encourages settle choices communicate Experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected problems agnosia failure decipher visual data Alzheimer disease

scholar endeavors study consciousness empirically nature defined scientific methods past psychologists Descartes dualistic theories line fundamental laws physics battle realists illusionists taking
