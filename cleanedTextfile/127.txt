How artificial intelligence affect environment Blackcoffer Insights When talk people perspectives There group people good knowledge potential solution problems world facing today There group people threatened thought taking world The field birth Alan Turing 1950 thought Can machines Later 1980s adoption expert systems companies world booming field initiated Initially matter awe results achieve growth past decades exponential transformed live work solve challenges made impact wide variety areas including healthcare education business But areas highest impact made recently environment climate Revolutionizing deal Environment Climate Change strengthen climate predictions enable smarter decision making decarbonising industries building transport work allocate renewable energy recent years game changer people organizations deal climate Microsoft believes artificial intelligence encompassing machine learning deep learning game changer climate environmental issues The company Earth program committed 50 million years create test applications increasingly manage intermittency renewable energy incorporated grid handle power fluctuations improve energy storage Wind companies turbine propeller produce electricity rotation incorporating weather operational data improve energy efficiency city scale incorporating data smart meters Internet Things internet computing devices embedded everyday objects enabling send receive data forecast energy demand Besides artificial intelligence systems simulate potential zoning laws building ordinances flood plains urban planning disaster preparedness One vision sustainable city create urban dashboard consisting data energy water availability traffic weather make cities energy efficient livable Hotter temperatures significant impacts agriculture Data sensors field monitor crop moisture soil composition temperature improve production crops watering Incorporating information drones monitor conditions increasingly automatic systems plant spray harvest crops head diseases problems This result increased efficiency enhanced yields lower water fertilizer pesticides But good downside When talk effect environment climate coin elucidated positives discussed usage downside Last year World Economic Forum report showed address Earth environmental challenges important manage properly According forum experts field potential accelerate environmental degradation The power intensive GPUs run machine learning training cited contributing increased C02 emissions Although half century question environmental impact ethical issues arising techniques developed decades combination explosion data strong computational power advances enabled artificial intelligence speech recognition driving cars systems consume lot power generate high volumes climate changing carbon emissions study year found training shelf language processing system produced 400 pounds emissions amount produced flying person roundtrip York San Francisco But make machine learning cleaner greener movement called Green Some algorithms power hungry training sessions moved remote locations power renewable sources The developers companies machine learning experiments spewing volumes reduced What prevent proposition World Economic Forum report advancements safe pursued ensure humanity developing harmful environment Specifically World Economic Forum report developers incorporate health natural environment fundamental dimension This means safeguarding models demand consumption energy natural resources sustainable factors sense programs designed dimension environmental protection improvement mind future development programs important note environmental impact creating systems According academic study energy usage deep learning processes creation effective costly environment Nearly 300 000 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent emissions created process training single model This basically equal emissions average cars United Considering negative environmental impact addition positive implications climate crucial moving forward There room improvement pioneers machine learning recently published paper called Tackling Climate Change Machine Learning discussed major conference David Rolnick postdoctoral fellow University Pennsylvania call arms means bring researchers This paper covers thirteen areas research machine learning including energy production CO2 removal education solar geoengineering finance The idea build energy efficient buildings creating carbon materials high tech monitoring deforestation greener transportation sources Artificial intelligence machine learning medium work caretaker mother earth How forecasting climate The kick start climate informatics 2011 regulates collaboration data science
