Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining difference Data oil important trendline 21st century The advancements fields data analysis The field Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining deal data developing staggering pace fields popular buzzwords days Buzzwords originated technical terms underlying essence fashionable impress This misconception people Stats Data Mining fields analysis data mistook words interchangeably convey But true The similarity disciplines disciplines analysis data converting data information academics learning Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored case articles explain difference Thus primary confusion learners Hence article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines wandering technical definitions The essential difference disciplines lies aims approach achieve aims The aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities Then satisfy aim understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent The answer questions found studying intelligent agents intelligent agent found standing front mirror Yes Humans examples intelligent entities Thus 1900s researchers began exploring thought process reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent Mimicking human behavior aim initial years research After setting goal studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human level performance cognitive tasks sufficient fool interrogator But test received criticism mimicking human behavior intelligence Because intelligence working human brain human brain intelligence meaning Thus mimicking human thought processes reasoning transformed aim The field Psychology philosophy resonate aim understand human thought process The difference understand thought process mimic build The collaboration fields resulted models Neural Networks mimic function neurons present human brain basically initial aim human centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent Concurrently field computer science developing greater pace With advances computer science experiments theories easily tested validated As programs applied solve life problems found computers performed humans tasks complex humans One examples chess playing program program defeated world chess player Garry Kasparov This incident human intelligence ultimate intelligence human defeat program This leads question human intelligence ideal intelligence As computers advanced proved humans complex tasks That definition intelligence ability solve cognitive tasks problems nature agents researchers began study nature intelligence Then question test validate intelligence The test intelligence solve cognitive problems agent intelligent solve complex problem The problem solving approach easily tested validated computers Thus researchers began studying ideal intelligence selected agent validate experiments computer computer problem solving approach adopted human centered approach computer problem solving approach aims Both fields contributed field giving valuable insights Both aims important collaboratively aim problem solving approach big challenge overcome order achieve aim Consider solving math problem There cases intelligence tested problem solving approach Let math problems solve The problem familiar problem Consider problem The problem familiar means solve kind problems solved similar problems past question mind solve problem The answer solved similar problems past learned past data solve problems problem past solve similar problems This intelligence Consider case problem solved kind problems past Then solve problem consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion This kind approach necessarily past data completely reasoning process This kind intelligence build intelligent agents kinds intelligence developed agent But reality reached point build agents learn past data find information today reached point build agents That type intelligence implement type intelligence Machine Learning domain focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning That called subset difference Technically speaking It field study computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions patterns explicitly programmed This statement elaboration The essence process Generalization learning past data Generalization abstraction properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims Consider humans recognize daily life objects If animal easily recognize dog It trivial task wondered mind The answer Generalization If picture dog easily recognize picture dog minds abstracted description dog formulated concept dog concepts learned past experiences dog dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds With generalization information computers ability generalize raw data convert information patterns trends data This discipline concerns collection organization analysis interpretation presentation data Statistics deal data aim explain study explaining data Statistics domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data Descriptive statistics It explain information easily large data complex task Inferential statistics make accurate inferences small data inference tasks daily lives Consider simple case cooking soup After completing recipe taste small sample spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad Depending result sample make inference soup soup good bad Similarly statistics cases apply inference meaningful information case gather data consuming costly cases applying inference based sample introduces uncertainty That inferential statistics data context uncertainty decision making face uncertainty statistics deals data statistics explain data This aim resonate statistics fields correctly interpret data Data raw Consider examples sensors industrial applications These sensors manufacturing plant sense properties temperature pressure The raw data generated sensors converted suitable processed analyzed gather valuable insights solve problem Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets gather insights Data Mining referred Knowledge Discovery That Carly Fiorina Hewlett Packard The goal turn data information information Insight This statement completely explains aim Data Mining difference Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims But approaches fields fulfilling aims fields This beauty fields
