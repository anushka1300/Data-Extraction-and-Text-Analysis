Lessons past Some learnings relevant coronavirus crisis Blackcoffer Insights The past prepared future As speak world finds engulfed worst crises recent The global COVID pandemic caused disruption economic life Not factories shut supply chains abruptly stopped millions workers stranded festivals suspended families separated countries healthcare systems put tremendous stress Such scenario world pandemics similar scale nature due struggle emerged victoriously As experienced remember SARS outbreaks 2000s presented similar scenario lower rate infection higher rates morbidity Going back 1918 Spanish Flu brought world world standstill Considered worst modern pandemics Influenza pandemic affected world population 50 million lives Yet preventive measures social distancing quarantine mass vaccinations support restraint proved successful situations effective occasional plague outbreaks world face similar situation today extremely infectious virus spread globally confined people homes causing tremendous economic loss minute economic activity remains suspended affecting government industries alike Can past similar incidents guide industries Can governments note policy measures adopted Spanish flu SARS outbreak helped eliminating pandemics What Government learn The panic due outbreak COVID importantly lockdown measures deal similar 1918 Influenza Pandemic commonly referred

heavy reliance social security systems causing sudden strain economic resources Impact Learnings Effective transparent communications crucial tools disease control presents great damage unleashed blackout Secondly censorship appease masses The term political impact censorship manipulation epidemic facts Still short term international unrest dissent deteriorated international relations At risk quoting clich established Streisand effect truth matter countries hide The Spanish Flu spread aggravated due failure policymakers adopting effective containment measures Research shows cities undertook measures reduce contact citizens 1918 displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared cities failed adopt disease containment policies quote results 2007 study Consistent hypothesis cities multiple interventions implemented phase epidemic peak death rates 50 lower steep epidemic curves They displayed lower cumulative mortality Contrasting Death Rates Philadelphia St. Louis 1918 Influenza Outbreak As guess Philadelphia levy restrictions gatherings parades social distancing measures St. Louis From study definition popular phrase flattening curve emerging spreading rate infection enabling health care systems treat people staggered manner line resources And corroborate result study shows trajectories disease cities Hence multiple debunking claims social distancing

shows disastrous consequences relaxation bans gatherings St. Louis death rates Spanish flu The pullback social distancing measures pursue economic interests premature caused sudden unprecedented surge number deaths due flu Deaths due Spanish Flu St. Louis Wider Picture The black grey lines show duration social distancing measures active Another peak death rates observed cities relaxed distancing measures prematurely Hence crucial past artifact governments compare inconveniences damage caused economy due measures benefits terms human life saved make call restrictions eased What industry learn The industry played role obscure fight worldwide outbreak But faces fair share challenges unprecedented Global industries weathered multiple natural disasters epidemics similar scale nature Their
